# Follow Content Node Implementation

This document describes the implementation of content nodes and transaction feed items for follow actions in the social feed.

## Overview

When a user follows another user, we now create a content node that appears in the transaction feed, similar to how swap transactions and pudgy profile claims are displayed.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Content Type Definition

Added a new `FollowContent` interface in `src/types/content.ts`:

```typescript
export interface FollowContent {
  type: 'follow'
  timestamp: string
  followId: string
  
  // Follower details
  followerUsername: string
  followerAddress: string
  followerImage: string
  followerBio: string
  followerFollowersCount: string
  followerFollowingCount: string
  
  // Followee details  
  followeeUsername: string
  followeeAddress: string
  followeeImage: string
  followeeBio: string
  followeeFollowersCount: string
  followeeFollowingCount: string
  
  // Relationship
  isMutualFollow: string
}
```

### 2. Content Creation Hook

Created `src/components/tapestry/hooks/use-create-follow-content.ts` which:
- Fetches profile information for both users
- Gets follower/following counts
- Checks if it's a mutual follow
- Creates a content node with all the relevant data

### 3. Transaction View Component

Created `src/components/home-transactions/components/follow-transactions-view.tsx` which displays:
- Beautiful card design with gradient backgrounds
- Different styling for mutual follows (pink/purple) vs regular follows (blue/indigo)
- User avatars with follower/following counts
- Arrow animation between users
- Stats showing the new follower gained
- Bio preview if available
- Responsive hover effects

### 4. Integration

Updated the following files to integrate the new functionality:

- **`src/components/tapestry/hooks/use-follow-user.ts`**: Modified to automatically create content nodes when following
- **`src/components/home-transactions/components/home-transaction-entry.tsx`**: Added routing for follow transaction types
- **`src/types/content.ts`**: Added `FollowContent` type and `isFollowAction` type guard

### 5. Enhanced Follow Button

Created `src/components/common/enhanced-follow-button.tsx` as an example implementation that:
- Handles both follow and unfollow actions
- Creates content nodes automatically
- Shows loading states
- Has multiple style variants (default, minimal, ghost)
- Supports different sizes (sm, md, lg)
- Shows "Unfollow" on hover when following

## Usage

To use the enhanced follow functionality:

```typescript
import { EnhancedFollowButton } from '@/components/common/enhanced-follow-button'

// Basic usage
<EnhancedFollowButton 
  targetUsername="alice"
  isFollowing={false}
/>

// With all options
<EnhancedFollowButton 
  targetUsername="alice"
  targetAddress="wallet_address"
  isFollowing={isFollowing}
  onFollowChange={(following) => console.log('Following:', following)}
  variant="minimal"
  size="sm"
  className="custom-class"
/>
```

## Feed Display

Follow actions now appear in the home transaction feed with:
- Clear visual distinction from other transaction types
- Mutual follow badge when applicable
- Follower count statistics
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Consistent design with other feed items

## Design Considerations

Based on the user's preferences:
- **Enhanced legibility**: Large, hierarchical text for usernames and stats
- **Background highlights**: Subtle gradients and backdrop blur for depth
- **Efficient space usage**: Compact card design with no wasted space
- **Visual consistency**: Matching button sizes and prominence
- **Status clarity**: Clear visual indicators for mutual follows

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Follow streak tracking
- Follow recommendations in the feed
- Batch follow actions
- Follow analytics and trends
- Social graph visualization
